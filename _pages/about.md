üëãüèº Hello there, my name is Jieming Ma(In its originality, È©¨‰ªãÊòé). I'm a graduate student in Computer Engineering at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/). Before that, I received my Bachelor in Electrical Engineering from Wuhan University of Science and Technology in 2020.

Previously, I spent a wonderful semester studying at Sichuan University, PMCIRI lab in spring 2021. I also interned at NYU Video Lab, Brooklyn in the spring and summer 2022, and NYU Multimedia and Visual Computing Lab, remotely in the spring and summer 2023, supervised by Pro. Yi Fang and Dr. Hao Huang. Now I am a research assistant at HIT(SZ), working with Pro. Lu Guangming.

My current research interests are in machine-learning and deep-learning models for solving computer-vision/image-processing tasks, with a particular focus on editable neural radiance field, medical image processing, and video object tracking.
