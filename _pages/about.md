üëãüèº Hello there, my name is Jieming Ma(In its originality, È©¨‰ªãÊòé). I'm a graduate student in Computer Engineering at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), [Tandon School of Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/). Before that, I received my Bachelor in Electrical Engineering from Wuhan University of Science and Technology in 2020.

Previously, I spent a wonderful semester studying at Sichuan University in fall 2020. I also interned at Amazon, Beijing in summer 2019, and Tencent Games, Shenzhen in summer 2020. I was a research assistant at NYU from spring 2021 to summer 2021.
